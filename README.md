# Microsoft.PdbDownloader
Extremely easy-to-use, drag and drop, .PDB file downloader for any Microsoft owned executable/libraries on Windows.

# Download
You can download the latest builds on the [releases](https://github.com/BerkanYildiz/Microsoft.PdbDownloader/releases) section of this repository.

# Requirements
 - Windows, x64

# Usage
Simply drag and drop the executable (.sys, .dll, .exe) on the application.  
It will automatically download and save the .PDB file at the same path as the executable that has been dropped in.

# Why
Well, because the only available PDB downloader on Github is very stupid, slow, and requires 200 clicks to get the PDB file.  
Also because IDA apparently does not want to automatically download the PDB file when I open a Microsoft executable. Pain in my ass.
